        <br><b>I cannot tell what specific drinks people drink the most at specific chain stores.</b><br><br>
        A solution to this is to create a personalized website or app for people to use individually. I initially thought about creating a solution, but a solution seems too far out there for me. I do not have the coding abilities to develop an app. Making an app takes a team of developers. I could create a website that allows people to calculate their calories, but would people really use such a site? Yet without an app or website tailored for each person, it is impossible to give a general result.<br><br>
        I *could* make harsh assumptions to develop a general result. I could find some surveys that analyze on average what kinds of drinks people drink over the year.
