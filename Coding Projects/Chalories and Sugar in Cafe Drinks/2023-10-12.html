      <p>
        <br><b>I created the a frame to organize and think through my projects.</b> I thought long and hard about this project yesterday and this morning. Yet my mind was cramping up with no decisions being made. There were two causes for this lack of progress.<br><br>
        The first cause was that my thoughts and ideas were disorganized. I had many ideas, sources, and ways I wanted to approach this project, but I needed a frame to separate and organize my thoughts. I created a frame:<br><br><br>
        Why the project is important, how I got to do this project (there is a central theme or keyword)
        The purpose and goals (one-line each)<br>
        Basic steps / plans<br>
        Problems & solutions throughout steps<br>
        Limitations & next steps for next time<br>
        <br>

        Under each component I will put a date and how I worked on that component.<br><br>


       <b>Another cause is that I did not make my purpose *clear* - or least, somewhat fixed - before moving onto finding sources and gathering data.</b>  I was unsure about my purpose when I began finding sources. Yet the sources I found could only support one purpose and not the other. As a solution I decided that tomorrow I will organize the directions this project can take into a tree diagram and pick one.
