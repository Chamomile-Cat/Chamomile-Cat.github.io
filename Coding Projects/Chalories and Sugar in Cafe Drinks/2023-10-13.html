        <a>Title: Establishing a Project Purpose</a>
        <p> <br><br>
        Last post I decided to organize all directions this project could take and choose one.  Organizing my past notes, there are three ways I can procced with this project. I could:<br><br>

        <b>1. Develop an app for users to track their personal cafe-going habits.</b> The app will show a database of nutritional information for drinks from certain cafes. Users can log what menu at which cafe they consumed. Users will receive information their consumption of calories, sugar, caffeine, etc. The app would warn people if they are consuming too much of calories, sugar, caffeine, etc.<br><br>

        <b>2. Analyze the statistics of my own personal cafe-going habits.</b> I would record what drinks I drink at what cafes for around 2-3 months. Then, the records are multiplied with nutrition facts to calculate my total intake of calories, sugar, caffeine, etc. After, my intake is compared to the daily recommended amount given by the WHO or the FDA.<br><br>

        <b>3. Analyze the statistics of a sample then generalize the results across a certain population.</b> I would take a segment of the population, then research their cafe drink consumption patterns. Then I would take nutritional information for those drinks to analyze the intake of calories, sugar, caffeine, etc.<br><br>

        <b>Taking the statistics and create a app so that individual people can calculate and analyze their personal cafe-going habits seems an unreasonably ambitious project.</b> Not only involves data analysis but also app development. I do not not know how to nor do I wish to develop apps, so I would need to find a collaborator to join me on this project. Unfortunately I do not think people near me would be interested in this project for now. Developing an app for individuals seems to large and unrealistic of a task. Additionally, the lives of individual people's health is a serious matter. Health apps should be based on solid medical literature or expertise. However, I do not have either to back any claims on the app. Therefore, developing a personalized health app requires too much coding and medical expertise for me at the moment.<br><br>

        <b>At the other end of the specturm, other critical disadvantages lie in analyzing the statistics of my own personal cafe-going habits.</b> I do think a personal analysis will reveal much about myself. It is always fun to analyze how I behave. I could find personal ways to improve my cafe habits. However, such personal analysis will not be difficult to generalize, and therefore, meaningful to other people. This project idea is too personal and subjective to be meaningful.<br><br>

        <b>As such, the compromise between the first and second project idea seems to be the best direction forward.</b> I decided to analyze the statistics then generalize the results across a certain population. Although this project idea does involve quite a bit of web-scrapping and data analysis, I have learned and created coding projects using both before. The project will be more manageable and simple to finish. Although this project idea does involve some sort of collecting data on a sample then generalizing the results, the sample and population is abstract enough that the analysis will not directly affect people's health. However, because I am not a medical expert, I should describe limitations of my project and put a disclaimer.<br><br>


        Therefore, the purpose of my project is to analyze the statistics of a sample then generalize the results across a certain population. However, the limitations of my analysis must be explicitly stated at the beginning of my analysis. A disclaimer should also be placed explaining I'm not a doctor and that the analysis is just a personal hobby project.<br><br>
