      <a id="title">Title: Study Map for NLP</a>
      <p class="words">
        <br><b>I need a list of all topics I need to somewhat cover in my Machine Learning studies. Combining too many sources to count online, I compiled the following list:</b> 
        <br><br>
        
        <li><b>Linguistics</b> including Phonetics & Phonology, Morphology, Syntax, Semantics, Pragmatics, Discourse Analysis, Sociolinguistics, Psycholinguistics, Corpus Linguistics</li><br>
        <li><b>Mathematics</b> including Linear Algebra (Vectors, matrices), Statistics (probability, distributions, and hypothesis testing), Calculus</li><br>
        <li><b>Programming</b> including Algorithms, Databases such as SQL, Machine Learning, Deep Learning Models, NLP Libraries, Machine Learning Frameworks</li><br>
        <li><b>Specific Computational Linguistics Topics</b> such as computational semantics, probabilistic models, translation, Q-A systems and chatbots, text summarization, sentiment analysis, cognitive modeling, argument mining just to name a few.</li><br>

        The list is not as long as I expected to be honest. I think I can cover the mathetmatics and machine learning, deep learning, and NLP libraries until the end of the year. I will record my studies and projects on this blog.
