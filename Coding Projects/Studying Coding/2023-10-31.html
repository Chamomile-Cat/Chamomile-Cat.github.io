      <a id="title">Title: Basic Machine Learning with TensorFlow</a>
      <p class="words">
        
        I learned the basics of how machine learning works via tensorflow. Here are my notes and review of Machine Learning.

        Disclaimer: I skipped modules 5 and 6 because I did not wish to use images and am already learning NLP at a Udemy Course.

        - AI is the largest term which encompasses Machine Learning which further encompasses Neural Networks. AI is are simply modes which can do intellectual takss like a human does. AI ranges from very simple methods to the most complex classification models. Machine Learning is a special form of AI that does not require pre-programmed rules or functions to guide the task. Rather, the machine learning model "learns" the data to find patterns on their own. While machine learning models might have only a few layers, neural networks have multiple layers. 
        <br>
        - Data is the core of machine learning. If there is not enough data or the data is not of high quality or the data is not cleaned properly, the model cannot learn effectively from looking at the data. Data can be split in two methods. The first is train data and test data. The second is features which are input into the model and labels which come out of the model. Labels are the "answers" when training and testing or predictions of the model when predicting using the model. 
        <br>
        - Tensors are defined as 1) "vectors generalized to a higher dimension" or 2) "partial computations" which do not have specific values running through them. For example, a tensor might be to "take the input values then return their sum". There are no specific values being added. Specific values only run through the tensor when it is evaluated on a session. Tensors have data types string, int, or float. String is very rare. <br>
        <mark>Maybe a sessions is called an "evaluation" because we are testing the accuracy/loss of the tensor?.</mark><br>
        <mark>I still have no idea what "vectors generalized to a higher dimension" means. i hope there is a specific example that ties the two definitions together.</mark><br>
        - The rank of a tensor is the total number of dimensions in the tensor. The shape of a tensor shows the number of elements in each dimension of the tensor. For example, a 3D tensor might look like [[[2,1], [5,2]], [[3,1], [4,2]]]. The rank of this tensor is 3 because the tensor has three dimensions. The shape of the tensor is (1, 2, 2) because there is one element in the first dimension, two elements in the second dimension, and another two elements in the third dimension.
        <br><br>
        - The following are some of the core models of machine learning. Regression is used when features seem proportional to each other. Regression models input interval/ratio and/or categorical data to predict an interval/ratio data by fitting a best line which summarizes and generalizes the correlations variables to the data. The lower the loss for , the more accurate the regresesion model is at predicting. Classification uses interval/ratio or categorical data to classify observations into categories(i.e., categorical data, categorical variable, categories). Clustering is for classifying data into groups <b>which is unknown beforehand </b>. Clustering predicts a value by putting down random centroids, calculating all distances between each data point and each centroids, then moving the centroids to the arithmetic mean of each clusters. Hidden Markov Models use conditional probability to predict the probability a certain state will occur. Reinforcement Learning is most often used in games to predict how an agent should move to maximize the reward.
