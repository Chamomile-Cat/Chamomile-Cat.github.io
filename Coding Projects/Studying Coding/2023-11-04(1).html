      <a id="title">Title: Basic Concepts</a>
      <p class="words">
        I am slowly realizing that <b>coding is not about the syntax but about the core underlying concepts behind the code.</b> For example, when it comes to machine learning, the concepts input-output-hidden layers, weights, and backpropagation are much more important than memorizing the syntax to create models.
        <br><br>
        I am also realizing that that <b>statistics are about the 'core' family groups</b>. The specific formulas and specific tests are important for sure. However, if I do not realize the larger group they belong in, all my statistics study builds up to is a haphazard list of disorganized formulas. Disorganization means that it is unclear when I should use which formula. 
        <br><br>
        I used to memorize syntax and formulas as much as possible. No matter how much I try, a week later all I've memorized is gone from my head. The formuals can be easily found with one quick Google search or skim through a book. Besides, there are so many different programming language, complicated syntax, and statistical tests out there for me to study and memorize them all.
        <br><br>
        <b>The purpose of studying coding and statistics are to develop a higher-level frame to recognize 1) when to use 2) which library/function 3) the core principle behind the code/formula and 4) how to interpret the results. 1~4 is enough for me to searc, read on, and understand more advanced and specific libraries or statistcs formulas.</b> For example, I could rote-memorize the formula for the one-way ANOVA test. However, if I do not understand that the ANOVA family of statistical tests are for 1) determining if there is a difference between three or more groups 2) by using the stats library in python 3) by comparing variance 4) if p < 0.05, then there most likely is a difference between the groups compared.
