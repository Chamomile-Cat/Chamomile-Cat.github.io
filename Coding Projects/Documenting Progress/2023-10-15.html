      <a>Title: Embedding Code into Blog without JavaScript</a>
      <p>
        <br><b>How do I embed python code into my blog post?</b>
        <br><br>
        I need a way to embed my code in my posts, I cannot continuously snip images from github then put them into HTML. There probably is a way to embed code into HTML with CSS. 
        
        I should check how Logseq embeds URLs because I normally embed code when I use Logseq. I opened a Logseq Page with all my Githube Python Code using VScode to see its format in markdown. Apparently all it does it does is use a ''' ''' to embed code in markdown. However, I am managing this webpage in HTML not markdown. <br>

        <br><br>
        I searched on Google "html python code block" and found the following two answers at 
        <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_code.asp">W3Schools</a>
         and  
        <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53510125/how-can-i-visually-display-a-block-of-python-code-utilizing-html-css-and-javascr">Stackoverflow</a>.

        <br><br>
        W3Schools suggest using the "code" tag in html along with CSS. The Stackoverflow answer suggests a Javascript I'll trying using the "code" tag with CSS first because I do not know JavaScript at all and the "code" tag with CSS looks promising. 
        
        <br><br>

        I used the <a href="https://coolors.co/f8f8f8-e0e9f5-050b0f-006daa-f5c536">coolers</a> website to create a palette for my code block. I made the background  was a blue color, which the code contrasts with. Then the whole website only uses three colors while the code is distinguishable from other texts.<br><br>  


        An example of me using the "code" tag in HTML <br><br>
        <code id="python">
            def add(a,b): <br>
            &emsp;return a+b <br>
            def multiply(a,b): <br>
            &emsp;else: return a*b <br><br>                
        </code>  

        Unfortunately the answer at W3Schools is not enough. The padding is not equal across every line of code because the CSS pads over texts not a certain area. I decided to use CSS to create a square then put my code within it. The CSS can be viewed from my <a id="githublink" href="https://github.com/Chamomile-Cat">Github</a>.<br><br>
        
        To create the CSS I learned how to put text into rectangles at the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS">CSS documentation</a>. I also referred to a  <a href = "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40842277/create-line-numbers-on-pre-with-css-only">Stackoverflow Answer</a> which illustrated how to put line numbers using counter-increment on varying levels of CSS. I finally learned about positioning in CSS to place the code where I want to. <br><br>
        The result looks like the following:<br>
        <pre>
        <span>def add(a,b):</span><br>
        <span>&emsp;return a+b</span><br>
        <span>def multiply(a,b):</span><br>
        <span>&emsp;else: return a*b</span><br>                
        </pre>
