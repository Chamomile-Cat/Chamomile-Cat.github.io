        <br><b>I wanted to redesign one of two websites I made before.</b><br><br>
        The first website I made by downloading an HTML and CSS template another person made and uploaded. While it was easy to fill in the content and edit the template, it was difficult to find a template that matched exactly what I needed and wanted. I also found it difficult to understand another person's CSS. Changing one element in the CSS would change other elements with the same tag as well. I would have to end up splitting the CSS for each individual element - at which point I should just create my website on my own.<br><br>
        So I set out to make out a web page from scratch. I first tried to dive straight into HTML coding. Yet, my webpage layout and content quickly became dirty and disorganized. I had an image in my brain of what I wanted the website to look like, but the image was so unclear and abstract for me to realize right away into HTML and CSS. So I backtracked and drew the specific layout and content of each page on paper. I chose and colored in each element with a color I wanted. Sadly I do not have the paper now as the drawing was made some time ago. Even more unfortunate, although I had the contents the way I wanted them, the design of the website was horrible. I tried many different color palettes but somehow there was always something wrong - too many dark colors, there colors did not go together well, the link at the bottom was unclear.<br><br>
        <b>So, this past week I decided to edit my website into a better design.</b><br><br>
        <b>The purpose of revamping my personal website is to have a lighter and cleaner design to 1) write posts on my coding project 2) upload my academic CV and 3) share my research interests and projects with other colleagues and potential employers.</b><br><br>
        <b>I faced many problems and had to overcome them while revamping my old personal website.</b><br><br>
        <b>I used fewer colors, each with a specific purpose.</b> My color palette failed with my last website because I was using too many colors. I also did not separate the colors into background and point colors. Therefore, the website was just a jumbled mess of strong colors. This time, I decided to select only one background color (grey) and one pointer color (blue), then changed the darkness of each across my website. I used the lightest grey color for the background, more darker colors for the header, and most darkest color for the main body, being careful that each element of the website could be easily found and read. The result was that my website looks more cleaner while also emphasizing important points.<br><br>
        <b>I added a character of myself.</b> I did not want to put a picture of my face on my website. However, I did want to put some form of my face so that people might recognize me when they first meet me. I also hoped to display some form of my personality so that people can feel more closer to me and at least guess what kind of person I am. Therefore, I compromised and created a character of myself using a character maker on https://picrew.me which allowed personal, non-commercial, and commercial use of the character. I uploaded the subsequent character onto my website.<br><br>
        <b>I added a google form so that people could easily and anonymously give feedback.</b> I realized that I had no way to receive feedback on my blog or coding except for my email. However, my email is often crowded with other emails from school, work and what not. I might miss feedback I did not want to miss. Writing an email takes more time and energy than filling out a form too. Some people might not want to reveal their name and email to me. Therefore, I created a google form to receive feedback. I added the google form to every end of my blog posts.<br><br>
        <b>Some future directions I wish to develop my personal website are:</b><br><br>
        <b>I should change the background</b> so that it has the same color but with one texture or patten. Looking at the webpage I like the simple colors, yet the whole web page seems a bit dull too. For example, I could have a fabric texture or like these pictures below.<br>
        I should use @media in CSS (https://developer.mozilla.org/ko/docs/Web/CSS/@media) to <b> allow my website to be viewed on tablet and phones.</b> Currently opening my website on a phone or tablet breaks much of the elements.<br>
        I should continue filling up website with research projects and coding projects such as this one.<br>
