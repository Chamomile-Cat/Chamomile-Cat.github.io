        <br>
        <b>One of the biggest challenges I face as a senior who wants to go to graduate school is determining which field of study I should go into.</b> Linguistics itself has so many sub-fields of study, many of which interset with other fields such as philosophy, cognitive science, computer science, biology just to name a few. These diverse fields were all interesting to me in their own way, leaving me scrambling for one field then the next, withtout a clear idea as to what I wished to study.
        <br>
        Of course, all that scrambling was not in vain. I learned, for example, that I wished to study applied linguistics rather than theoretical linguistics. I also realized that I enjoy solving real-life problems impacting daily lives. <b>Nevertheless, I continuously yearned for a more systematic way to determine which fields of studies I was interested in because there were so many fields out there which I did not know about yet.</b>
        <br>
        Recently I came across a book called <b>"The Early career Researcher's Toolbox" by Andres De Los Reyes.</b> The book details the skills from graduate students to early faculty members should develop. From pages 77-78 the author details a systematic way to determine my field of interest:
        <br>
        Step 1: Find journals in fields which interest you<br>
        Step 2: Skim the table of contents of a few issues from the past 5 years, noting which titles interest you the most. <br>
        Step 3: Read abstracts to find most intersting articles.<br>
        Step 4: Read the articles from Step 3.<br>
        Step 5: Generalize the topics or research questions of these articles. <br>
        <br>
        <b>These steps by Dr. Reyes are wonderful.</b> Following these steps, I can systematically determine my research intersts. Furthermore, I refer to previous and recent research, preventing me from developing research interests that are not being studied or cannot be studied. I also get a list of potential mentors to supervise me during my PhD, along with potential journals I can submit my work into. Finally, I have a list of articles to refer to when writing my future essays or dissertations. In some sense, the steps by Dr. Reyes are a sort of higher-level literature review. 
        <br>
        I decided to make some of the stopes more specific to my context into the following:
        <br>
        Step 1: Find Q1 journals in the fields of Linguistics, Second Language Acquisition, and English Education from the 2022 JCR report. This step should result in a list of about 20 Q1 journals from JCR. 
        → I added in a specific outcome (e.g., an essay, a list) of what each step should produce so that I do not get side-tracked and I select only those journals and issues which interest me the most. 
        <br>
        Step 2: Classify the journals that I found into topic groups. For example, some topics which might come up are assessment, psycholinguistics, or pedagogy. This step should result in around 3-4 major groups of journals. 
        → Step 2 was added because having diverse interests, it is more likely that my list of journals span across several interrelated fields. Therefore, I decided to make the process more organized by classifying journals by topic. 
        <br>
        Conduct Step 3~6 for each journal in each group.
        Step 3:  Skim the editor's note of the past 5 years of issues, noting which issues have interesting themes. This step should result in a list of around 5 issues per each journal. 
        → Step 3 was added for two reasons. One is that I often find that almost all the articles some issues of journals interest me while other issues from the same journal do not interest me at all. The second reason is to reduce the time I spend into every single table of contents for each issue. I determined that Step 1 should result in 20 journals - each journal has around 2-4 issues per year. If we study the past 5 years of issues, that leads to 300 table of contents. Selecting a few issues by theme shall help me greatly reduce the number of uninteresting table of contents. 
        <br>
        Step 4: Read the table of contents of the interesting issues, recording into excel the titles and abstracts of interesting articles. This step should result in a list of around 15 articles per each journal. 
        <br>
        Step 5: Read the abstracts of the articles recorded in Step 2, noting which articles I wish to read in full. This step should result in a list of around 5~10 articles per each journal. 
        <br>
        Step 6: Read the introduction and conclusions in full from Step 3. This step should result in annotated articles and summaries of articles from Step 4. 
        → I did not wish to read all the articles from front to back. I would not have the time, nor would I be able to understand every article in detail. 
        <br>
        Step 6: Generalize the topics or research questions of these articles. This step should result in a list of the major research areas / issues I wish to study. 
        <br>
        This project is expected to take aroudn 1 month. I will contantly work on this project for 2-3 hours during the evening of the weekday after I finish my daily classes.
