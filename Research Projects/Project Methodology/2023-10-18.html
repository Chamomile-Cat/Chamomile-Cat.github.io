      <p class="words">

        Methodology is the data gathering and analyzing method in answering a certain research question. In other words, methodology is how a researcher reaches a certain conclusion or confirms or disconfirms a certain hypothesis. Researchers confidence in their conclusions rely on their methodology. Methodologies also shape research questions because certain research questions best answered through certain methodologies. Certain methodologies assume fundamental concerns about logic, truth, and knowing as well.  
        <br><br>
        Most researchers cannot follow all lines of research. Only certain lines of research are possible to most researchers. Therefore, researchers understanding methodology can design their research in a more specific and realistic manner.
        <br><br>
        1. <b>Interviews</b> involve a researcher asking a series of questions to participants, with the answers that participants give are the data to be analyzed. Some research questions that might involve interviews are "How to teachers feel about a recent policy change?" or "What are student's opinions on a certain activity done in class?" 
        <br><br>
        2. <b>Questionnaires</b> involve a researcher distributing a sheet of questions for participants to answer. Questionnaires and interviews are similar in that they ask questions to a sample. The key difference is that questionnaires often allow close-ended answers with only some open-ended answers to be analyzed using statistical measures. In contrast, most interviews mostly ask open-ended questions to elicit rich answers to analyze.
        <br><br>
        3. <b>Field observations</b> involve a researcher observing and recording an authentic educational situations (e.g., teachers teaching, students doing tasks). Details of the authentic situations are the data to be analyze. The power of field observations come from studying authentic, that is, real-life, and thus, rich and intricate data which experiments or thought-experiments might lack.
        <br><br>
        4. <b>Psycholinguistic experiments</b> involve experiments to identify a phenomenon or determine the cause and effect relationships between variables.
        <br><br>
        5. <b>Corpus Linguistics</b> involve researchers analyzing large quantities authentic spoken and written texts. A research question that might involve corpus linguistics is "How many of the written errors made by L2 students phrases coming directly from their L1?" Another type research question that might involve corpus linguistics is "How do the errors students make in written texts relate to their proficiency levels?" 
        <br><br>
        6. <b>Discourse and conversation analysis</b> both involve researchers analyzing the meta structure of a spoken or written text of at least two utterances. A research question that might involve discourse or conversation analysis is "How does different confidence levels in their L2 proficiency cause L2 learners to interact with a native language user?"
