      <a id="title">Title: Step 2, Classifying Journals by Topic</a><!-- EDIT -->
      <p>
        <br>
        <b>I classified the 20 Q1 journals I found into topic groups.</b> The journals that I found could be sorted into 1) journals covering wide general topics such as general education or language acquisition 2) journals focusing in specific areas such as writing assessment or educational technology in learning a new language. The resultant groups are:
        <br><br>
        1. General Acquisiton and/or Teaching of Language<br>
        2. Review journals<br>
        3. Writing<br>
        4. Reading<br>
        5. Assessment<br>
        6. Language Learning & Technology
        <br><br>
        I wish I could record the specific journal names of each category because my blog posts will become much more engaging and detailed than ever before, but I have to ask Clarivate to distribute their content first. I did send emails to their legal department three times, but an auto-generated "The recipient's mailbox is full and can't accept messages now." message keeps returning from postmaster@clarivate.com I will have to try later again. I hope that I will be able to write specific journal names sooner or later. 
        <br><br>
        <b>In the mean time, there were two major issues to consider when classifying journals. The first was that many journals could be classified into more than one cateogry.</b> <a href="https://www.springer.com/journal/11145">The journal Reading and Writing</a> for example, could be classified under both 3. Writing and 4. Reading. Articles in <a href="https://ila.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/19362722">Reading Research Quarterly</a> have many articles not just on reading or writing as well, such as the article "Cognitive and Motivational Challenges in Writing: Studying the Relation With Writing Performance Across Students’ Gender and Achievement Level" in Vol. 53, Issue 2, or "Automated Scoring of Students’ Use of Text Evidence in Writing" in Vol. 55, Issue 3.
        <br><br>
        <b>Similarly, the second isssue is that it is unclear where to classify journals covering a wide range of topics.</b> Technically, they do over topics that could be classifed into "writing", "Reading", "Assessment", and "Language Learning & Technology". However, because the journals also deal with many topics outsdie these categories, I decided to classify these general journals into categories "General Acquisiton and/or Teaching of Language" and "Review journals". Although I did classify fournals into categories for now, I might have to re-classify them based on the topic of each article title rather than journal title. I will have to skim the topics that come up after I finish reading the table of contents of each journal.
