      <p>
        <br>
        <b>Step 1 was to create a list of reputable journals in areas which I am interested in.</b>
        <br><br>
        <b>Unfortunately, I do not know much about the fields I am interested at the moment to pull a list out of my head.</b> I will have to rely on other expert's opinions and judgement to help me, which is why I decided to find Q1 journals in the 2022 JCR report. This step should result in a list of about 20 Q1 journals from Journal Citation Report. At the time I knew that what the Journal Citation Report was, but I did not know how to access or search the Journal Citation Report. To learn about how to use JCR, I found an online free lecture on JCR by ProQuest on 2023-10-20. A open free video record of the lecture can be found here(ADD LINK: https://proquest.libguides.com/korean#s-lg-box-29170402)
        <br><br>
        <b>Journal Citation Reports (JCR) are statistics published by Clarivate every year on journals.</b> Statistics include citations, journal rank, half-life, open access percentage, and much more. Based on these statistics, journals are curated into four core collections: The top journals with high impact across all elements are in SCIE (Science Citation Index Expanded), SSCI (Social Sciences Citation Index), and AHCI (Arts & Humanities Citation Index), while journals of high quality with relatively lower impact are categorized under the ESCI (Emerging Source Citation Index) collection. Journals are further categorized into broad fields such as Arts & Humanities, Chemistry, Computer Science, among others, with sub-collections for specific sub-topics within each major field.
        <br><br>
        Q1 journals are journals with the top 25% percentile of average citations per article compared to other journals in similar fields. For example, the journal "Computational Linguistics"(ADD LINK) ranks 16th out of 145 journals in the category"computer science, artificial intelligence. Some interdisciplinary journals can have rankings in two or more categories with different rankings for each one. For instance, the journal "TESOL Quarterly"(ADD LINK) ranks 81 out of 759 journals in the category Education & Educational Research, while ranking 31th out of 289 journals in the cateogry Linguistics. These ranking in different categories might show in which area the journal focuses more - TESOL Quarterly most likely focuses on language acquisition. 
        <br><br>
        <b>I searched journals in my area of interest based on the 2022 JCR.</b> Currently I am interested in Linguistics(Second Language Acquisition) and English Education. Based on the 2022 JCR, I searched for Q1 journals in the categories Linguistics, Langauge & Linguistics, and Education & Educational Research across all four core collections. I exported the journals I searched into an excel file. Upon opening the file, I reviewed the scope of each journal to determine the journal aligned with my interests. For the interesting journals, I added tags on the topics for each interesting journal. For example, for the journal "Assessing Writing" I added the tags "Assessment, Language learning/acquisition", and for the journal "Annual Review of Applied Linguistics" I added the tags "Review". 
        <br><br>
        <b>I had to narrow down my results into 20 Q1 journals.</b> The result of my selecting and tagging journals resulted in almost 30 journals. This was much more than the 20 Q1 journals I was expected to get. Of course, 10 doesn't seem like much. However, considering that I have to look through the past 5 years of each journal, even 10 more journals would result in at least 20 hours of more work. To make my work more efficient, I ranked the tags I had by priority. The highest priority tag was "Language learning/acquisition". I In other words, "Language learning/acquisition" was the core tag for me. Therefore, I filtered the interesting journals with the tag "Language learning/acquisition" - which resulted in around 20 Q1 journals.
